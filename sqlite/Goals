Wines should be in a list. 

Wine List: returns list of wine
  Wine List <Grape>
  Wine List <Vineyard>
  Wine List <Grape> <Vineyard> 
  
  I want to give List a term and have it generate the proper query to find those wines.
  In order to do that, I need to know column the term is.
  I can set up a dictionary where each term is added to the dictionary; when List gets 
  that term, it checks the dict to see what the proper column is. The dictionary should
  be stored on disk so it doesn't disappear when Wine isn't running.

  Dictionary should be a yaml file. When is the best time to read it into memory?
    at boot? or at Wine invocation?

Wine Drink <Bottle>: lowers quantity by one, asks for date. If you are now out, alerts you.

Wine Thoughts <Bottle>: prints the dates on which the wine has been drunk, and the reviews.

Wine Review <Bottle>: prompts you for thoughts on the bottle, adds to comments.

Wine Add <Bottle>: prompts you for information on the bottle and adds it to the list.
